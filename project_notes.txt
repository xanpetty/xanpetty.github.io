--gltf model--

While converting an SVG over to gltf Blender created 2 files: 

  a.gltf
  buffer_a.bin

The gltf is text data and links to a bin file which is much larger and contains binary data.


--obj model--

While converting an SVG over to obj Blender created 2 files:

  a.obj
  a.mtl

I currently don't know what the difference is but the obj file is the much larger of the two.


--TTF font--

when generating a TTF font in FontForge for conversion to .json with https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/ an error will be generated by facetype about a "bad apple kern class"

to avoid this during generation of the font

File-v
    Generate Fonts-v
                  Options

Put a check mark next to "OpenType" and "Old style 'kern'"

Also TTF files require quadratic curves which is set with

Element-v
       Font Info-v
                Layers
               
Select the radio button next to "All layers quadratic"


--A-frame text geometry--

The A-frame text geometry component wraps the three.js text geometry component. Information about attributes like bevel and height are available here:
https://threejs.org/docs/?q=textge#api/geometries/TextGeometry

The text geometry component requires a json format font which is can be obtained from https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/
